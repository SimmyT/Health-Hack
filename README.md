Perth Health Hack 
#Summary
This repository includes the codes for the reports of the Perth Healt Hack. The object of this great week end was to be able to do a reproducible report about the analysis conduct in one of the Perth Hospital. 
The data set is made of more than half million observation take over a period of one and half year. 

#The code 

The report is named  _bloodsamplecollection_, if you want to run it, clone this repository and it should run. The script common.R includes the data file definition, if you want to change their directory the changes shoud be done in this file.

About the data, the main dataset is in two format, txt and Rda. During the first run of the report the Rda file will be generated, if you rerun the report this data set will be loaded and therefore be faster to generate. 


#The report

One the final aim was to generate a reproducible report. Yuu can see the report about the blood sample analysis, by going to the folder project report. 

The R markdown, _bloodsamplecollection_ is the script to use to generate this report.
