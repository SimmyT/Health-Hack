# Health-Hack
Perth Health Hack  of Ocober 2015. This repository includes the work of the team, who worked on one accute problem in Hospital, the quality of analysis. 

#Summary
This repository includes the code and data used during this event. The aim of this great week end was to be able to write a reproducible report about the analysis conducted in one of the Perth Hospital. 
The data set is made of more than half million observations taken over a period of one and half year. 

#The code 

The main report is  _bloodsamplecollection_, if you want to run it, clone this repository and it should run. The script common.R includes the data file definitions, if you want to change their directory the changes shoud be done in there.

About the data, the main dataset is in two formats, txt and Rda. During the first run of the report the Rda file will be generated, if you rerun the report this data set will be loaded and therefore it will be be faster to regenerate your report. 


#The report

You can see the  final report about the blood samples analysis, by going to the folder project report.  The bood sample analysis for this report were from two emergency wards. 

The second type of analysis is about the urine test and will be added soon. 

The R markdown, _bloodsamplecollection_ is the script to use to generate this report.

#The next steps

You could expect a Web based report in the coming day.
